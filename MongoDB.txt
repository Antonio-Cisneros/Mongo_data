%Create a variable in MongoDB
	You have to write:
## Remember to use the  { to open the statement and } to close it.
## Also use the , to separate the statements of the variable
## Use the "" for strings, instead of write the number's name like "nineteen"
## Write the number 
	> var book_1 = { "book's name": "Siddartha", "Author": "Hermann Hesse"}

%To call the variable and see its contents
	> book_1
%It will display the content of the variable using the braces.


%Create a database 
	> use Silmaril

%Show that we are in the Database
	> db
%The output will be the name of the database that we already create
	> Silmaril

%To change into another DB 

%Visualize the DB that are already created and also display the storage of the database
	> show dbs

%Insert a collection in a database, it would be state or write in the following way.
## Use the () to start the and ends the insertion of a new collection.
	> db.books.insert({"book's name": "Siddartha",
		"Author": "Hermann Hesse"})


%To display and visualize which are the collection(s) that we created just type
	> db.books.find()
###The contents will be display and their ID


%We can also use the command find to display an specific field of the query
	> db.books.find({"book's name": "Siddartha"})

%Adding integer and float values are available for MongoDB
> db.books.insert({"book's name": "Siddartha", 
	"Author": "Hermann Hesse",
	"price": 200,
	"Publisher": "New directions"})
%The Dates can be added
> db.books.insert({"book's name": "Siddartha", 
	"Author": "Hermann Hesse",
	"price": 200,
	"Publisher": "New Directions",
	"tryDate": new Date(1992, 6, 28)})

% We can store in the collections any type of data using an array
> db.books.insert({"book's name": "Siddartha", 
	"Author": "Hermann Hesse",
	"price": 200,
	"Publisher": "New Directions",
	"tryDate": new Date(1992, 6, 28)
	"Page": ["Parameters"]})

%You can remove() to delete document that would match or not with the rigth query
	> db.books.remove({"book's name": El Principito})
#The output would show that the remove was did.
#If you a write a certain parameter, it will remove those documents which match with the paramater to remove

%Updating an existing document you have to use the update() option
#You must use the "$set" if you only write "set" that will be your new parameter
	> db.books.update({"book's name": "El principito"},
		{"$set": {"Author": Antoine de Saint-Exupéry})

%If you want to update no just one document, update all the documents that match with the new parameter of the query
#Use "multi":true for that.
	> db.books.update({"book's name": "El principito"},
		{"$set": {"Author": Antoine de Saint-Exupéry},
		{"multi": true})

#It will match with the other documents which have the same parameter.

%If you want, you can create a counter and you wanted to increase it in a log document.
%Use the $inc operator.
	> db.logs.update({"Weapon": Iron Greatsword},
		{"$inc": {"count": 1}})
#If you do that but the document doesn't exist, it won't do anything.
#Apply the option "upsert" for that.
	> db.logs.update({"Weapon": Iron Greatsword},
		{"$inc": {"count": 1}},
		{"upsert": true})
#If you repeat the same command the counter will change or increase according to the "upsert" option.

##Let's add 3 documents.
	> db.potions.insert({"name": "Fus Rho Da", "Color": "Blue"})
	> db.potions.insert({"name": "Storm", "Color": "Purple"})
	> db.potions.insert({"name": "Slay Dragon", "Color": Red"})
	
%Removing the fields from a collection that you never use is possible.
##Use the $unset operation for that.
##The brackets {} means that you are selecting all the potions collections.
##Also use the multi = true option you verify the match between documents and parameters.
	> db.potions.update({},{"$unset": {"color": ""}},{"multi": true})

%Insert a new potion with a secret ingredient
	> db.potions.insert(
	{"name": "Cure disease",
	"Vendor": "Arcadia",
	"price": 164,
	"score": 67,
	"tryDate": new Date(2011, 4,23),
	"ingredients": ["Blisterwert", "secret", "Mudcrab chitin"],
	"ratings": {"strength": 8, "flavor": 5}
	}
)
	
##If you want to change field names, use the $rename operator for that.
	> db.potions.update({},
	{"$rename": {"score": "grade"}},
	{"multi": true}
	)
## use the find() and observe what happen with the field.
##The field that you changed, it will be moving at the end of the potions.

%Knowing a "secret" ingredient in a document you must require the update() options
##As the parameter is an array you have to write all the elements
##Another option is using the position of the value which will be change.
	> db.potions.update(
	{"name": "Cure disease"},
	{"$set": {"ingredientes.1": "Sugar"}}
	)
##Use the find() option to verify if the update was did.
##Insert more potions and use the ingredients.$ for all the arrays.

%Doing the same statement if you want to update a field that was wrote in {}
	> db.potions.update(
	{"name": "Cure disease"},
	{"$set": {"ratings.strength": 10}}
	)
	
MongoDB provides a diversification of methods to modify values or fields.
	$max --> Update the greater value or it's created 
	$min --> Update the lower value or it's created
$mul --> Multiplies the current field by specifing the value, if it's empty gives you 0

##Let's insert another document
	> db.potions.insert({"name": "Shrinking", "vendor": "Faradas",
	"categories": ["tasty", "effective"]})

%Using the $pop operator will remove the value depending either the first or last value
	> db.potions.update({"name": "Shrinking"}, {"$pop": {"categories": 1}})

##The output will show only first element

##Using $push operator will do the opposite it will add another value and it will be at the end
##Additionally, $addToSet operator will add a value to the end, if the value exist it doesn't change and if not it will be added.
##A relative of $pop operator is $pull operator that will remove using the name of the value.

%You can find multiple parameters using the find() option
	> db.potions.find(
	{
	"vendor": "Kettlecooked",
	"rating.flavor": 5})
#It will display the name of the documents.

Comparison operator

$gt	Greater than
$gte	Greater than or equal to
$ne	Not equal to
$lt	Less than
$lts	Less than or equal to

%You can use the find() options by applying a comparsion between prices, inequality, range
	> db.potions.find({"price": {"$gt": 10, "$lt": 20}})
	> db.potions.find({"vendor": {"$ne": "Kettlecooked"}})
	> db.potions.find({"sizes": {"$elemMatch": {"$gt": 8, "$lt": 16}}})
